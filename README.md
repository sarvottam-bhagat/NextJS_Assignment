# Clean Web Style Next.js Application

This is a modern messaging application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It uses Supabase for backend services.

## Implemented Features

### Core Requirements ✅

- ✅ **Real-time Messaging**: Typing and pressing send on the input box displays the typed message on the chat screen as part of the conversation. Messages are added to the database and shown in real-time.

- ✅ **User-to-User Messaging**: Users can send messages to another user. Messages are displayed to the other user in real-time.

- ✅ **Conversation Navigation**: Clicking a chat opens the conversation for that chat.

### Optional Requirements ✅

- ✅ **Filters and Search for Chats**
- ✅ **Labels for chats**
- ✅ **Member assignment to different chats**

### Bonus Features ✅

- ✅ **Group Chat functionality**
- ✅ **Attachment support (video, image, etc.)**
- ✅ **Semantic HTML tags implementation**
